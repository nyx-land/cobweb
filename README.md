# Cobweb ðŸ•¸

Cobweb is yet another sexp->HTML emitter library for Common Lisp, but
also much more.

Unlike the other sexp emitters that currently exist for CL, Cobweb
isn't just a more convenient syntax for writing HTML using
macros. It's also a full mapping of CLOS to the W3 specification for
HTML, autogenerated using the `COBWEB-GEN` system. This means that
when using Cobweb to write HTML, you're not just working with plain
lists, but rather have the full power of CLOS and the MOP at your
disposal to do whatever you want with the DOM.

Cobweb also has the advantage of being generated from the W3 spec
rather than at the discretion of the implementer or by relying on a
simple non-validating macro system. It turns out that it's rather
trivial to do this thanks to the machine-readable version that W3
provides, and with how important backwards-compatibility is for the
web it's unlikely that it'll change drastically anytime soon.

## Why would I want this?

You may not have any use case for this and be better off with
Spinneret or CL-WHO, but for my own purposes, I wanted to be able to
implement some fancy features for Cobweb's sister project Widow and
being able to use the MOP seemed like the best way to do it.

## Usage

You probably don't need to use `COBWEB-GEN`, which is the system for
generating the HTML. It's in a separate system to avoid cluttering
Cobweb with any dependencies that aren't necessary for run-time.

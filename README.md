# Cobweb ðŸ•¸

Cobweb is yet another sexp->HTML emitter library for Common Lisp, but also much more.

Unlike the other sexp emitters that currently exist for CL, Cobweb isn't just a more convenient syntax for writing HTML using macros. It's also a full mapping of CLOS to the W3 specification for HTML, autogenerated using the `COBWEB-GEN` system. This means that when using Cobweb to write HTML, you're not just working with plain lists, but rather have the full power of CLOS and the MOP at your disposal to do whatever you want with the DOM.

Cobweb also has the advantage of being generated from the W3 spec rather than at the discretion of the implementer or by relying on a simple non-validating macro system. It turns out that it's rather trivial to do this thanks to the machine-readable version that W3 provides, and with how important backwards-compatibility is for the web it's unlikely that it'll change drastically anytime soon.

## Why would I want this?

You may not have any use case for this and be better off with Spinneret or CL-WHO, but for my own purposes, I wanted to be able to implement some fancy features for Cobweb's sister project Widow and being able to use the MOP seemed like the best way to do it.

## Installation

You will need to clone this [somewhere that ASDF can find it](https://asdf.common-lisp.dev/asdf.html#Configuring-ASDF-to-find-your-systems), unless I decide this project is good enough to submit to Quicklisp. Then you can `(ql:quickload :cobweb)` it.

All the symbols are exported from the `COBWEB` package for convenience (pending better package organization).

## Usage

Cobweb exports two macros, `WITH-HTML` and `WITH-HTML-WRITE`, along with all the classes and accessors and the writer function `HTML-WRITER`. For now we mainly care about `WITH-HTML-WRITE`.

`WITH-HTML-WRITE` accepts a `STREAM` and an `&BODY` form to be read with `HTML-WRITER` and transformed into HTML. `STREAM` takes the same arguments as `FORMAT`: `NIL` returns a string, `T` prints to stdout, or otherwise it can be any other stream. It will return the written HTML and the objects.

```common-lisp
CL-USER> (ql:quickload :cobweb)
To load "cobweb":
  Load 1 ASDF system:
    cobweb
; Loading "cobweb"

(:COBWEB)
CL-USER> (describe 'cobweb:with-html)
COBWEB.USER:WITH-HTML
  [symbol]

WITH-HTML names a macro:
  Lambda-list: (&BODY BODY)
  Source file: /Users/nyx/code/projects/cl/cobweb/src/user.lisp
; No values
CL-USER> (describe 'cobweb:with-html-write)
COBWEB.USER:WITH-HTML-WRITE
  [symbol]

WITH-HTML-WRITE names a macro:
  Lambda-list: (STREAM &BODY BODY)
  Source file: /Users/nyx/code/projects/cl/cobweb/src/user.lisp
; No values
CL-USER> 
```

Here's an example that prints to stdout and returns the objects:

```common-lisp
CL-USER> (in-package :cobweb.user)
#<PACKAGE "COBWEB.USER">
USER> (let ((css #P"/static/css/style.css")
            (lyrics (uiop:split-string

                     :separator '(#\newline))))
        (with-html-write t
          (html ()
            (head ()
              (link (:rel "stylesheet" :href (namestring css)))

              (body ()
                (h1 () "Spiders")

### Customizing the Formatter

`HTML-WRITER` is a method and can be customized like any other method to control how the HTML is printed. By default it pretty-prints the HTML, but for even moar flexibility, every HTML macro in addition to having attribute keyword options also accepts a `FMT` keyword that can be used to customize the formatting for that individual object. If you do this, you must pass in a `LAMBDA` that takes five arguments: `(STREAM OBJECT &optional AT COLON INDENT)`. This is because when `HTML-WRITER` encounters an HTML object with the `FMT` slot bound, it calls it with all the args that `HTML-WRITER` receives since it recurses through a list of objects and makes calls to CL's `FORMAT` to handle printing everything nicely.

For convenience, you may also use the `FORMAT-HTML` function that Cobweb exports within your custom `FMT` lambda to handle printing out tags and attributes. For instance, here's a way to disable pretty-printing entirely (useful if you're enclosing something in a tag that uses `PRE` style whitespacing):

```common-lisp
USER> (let ((lyrics (uiop:split-string
                     (alexandria:read-file-into-string #P"~/lyrics.txt")
                     :separator '(#\newline))))
        (with-html-write t 
          (loop for line in lyrics
                collect (span (:fmt (lambda (s obj &optional at colon indent)
                                      (declare (ignore at colon indent))
                                      (format-tag s obj
                                                  "~{~a~}" (coerce (html-body obj) 'list))
                                      (format s "~%")))
                          line))))
<span>Time moves like spiders</span>
<span>Over the face of the clock</span>
<span>Time's forward violence</span>
<span>Eating away at the heart</span>
<span></span>
<span>Another hour's past</span>
<span>They never seem to last</span>
<span>Another day goes by</span>
<span>No matter how I try</span>
<span></span>

# A Note on `COBWEB-GEN`

`COBWEB-GEN` does technically work but it's still pretty hacky and bad so I wouldn't recommend touching it right now. However, if you really must regenerate the spec (if perhaps you've made changes to `spec-src.lisp` or `package-src.lisp`), you can do the following:

```common-lisp
CL-USER> (ql:quickload :cobweb-gen)
To load "cobweb-gen":
  Load 1 ASDF system:
    cobweb-gen
; Loading "cobweb-gen"
..................
(:COBWEB-GEN)
CL-USER> (in-package :cobweb-gen)
#<PACKAGE "COBWEB-GEN">
COBWEB-GEN> (write-files (get-spec))
T
```

# Potential Improvements

-   Fix `COBWEB-GEN` bugs
-   Add some utilities to walk through the DOM
